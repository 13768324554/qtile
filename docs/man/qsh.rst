qsh [-s qtilesocket]

``qsh`` is the remote shell tool for ``qtile``. ``qsh`` supports manipulating
various pieces of qtile remotely via an interactive shell.

Options:
    -s qtilesocket, --socket qtilesocket

        Use qtilesocket for IPC communication. This can be useful if you
        are trying to connect to/inspect another X session's running qtile
        instance from your own X session (or perhaps restart qtile from a
        tty).
