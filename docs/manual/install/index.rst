*Warning*: all of these distro guides are out of date with the cffi branch.
Please install from source for now. Installation will be _much_ simpler in the
very near future.

Below are the preferred installation methods for specific distros. If you are

======================

Qtile relies on some cutting-edge features in PyCairo, XCB, and xpyb. Until the
latest versions of these projects make it into distros, it's best to use recent
checkouts from their repositories.

Here is a brief step-by-step guide to installing Qtile and its dependencies
from source:
